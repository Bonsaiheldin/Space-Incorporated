# Space Incorporated
The biggest thing i ever programmed. An unfinished HTML5 2D space game i made to teach myself JavaScript. It's made entirely from scratch, without any library or framework, just using a 2d canvas and a simple text editor.

You can play it on https://bonsaiheldin.github.io/Space-Incorporated/

**Controls**
* Moving: WASD or arrow keys
* Shooting: Space

Be aware of bugs here and there and please don't report them. There's much i'm doing different today and if i decide to continue this i would recreate it from scratch. :)
